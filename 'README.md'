The above excel file is about the project of a data analysis the title of this project is Indian Premier League and it has the data which includes the ipl seasons from the year 2009 to the year 2023
and it has the data of the each season winners and the stadiums of which the matches have been played and the name of the cities of the respective stadiums located and having the data of the teams 
who have won the toss and what they have selected based on their winning and having the data of the man of the matches of the respective seasons and the player of the series of the respective seasons. 
Here i have used the tool called Excel and in that i have used pivot tables and some important formulas like vlookup etc and used so many visualizations like charts ,pie charts,graphs,tree graphs
to visualize the data and the insights i have gained in this project is that i have designed this project in such a way that it consists of all the seasons mentioned and in each season which team won the title
and which team is the runner up and who is the player of the series in that respective season and the matches which won by team who selected bat first and field first and i have used the stacked charts
to visualize it and then i have gained insights of top match venues where the teams won mostly by selecting the bat first and field first and then the toss winning percentage of bat first and field first
and gained insights on the overall title winners from the starting of the season to the last season and i have made the visualization using the tree chart and i have gained insights of the man of the matches
won most of the times in the respective seasons by a player and this will be looked with each season and for the all seasons i have used slicer for mentioning all ipl seasons and connected with the pivot chart
and all the visualizations i have made and hence this is the insights i have made from the project i have done.
